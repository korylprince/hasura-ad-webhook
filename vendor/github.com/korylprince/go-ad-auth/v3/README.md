# About

`go-ad-auth` is a simple wrapper around the great [ldap](https://github.com/go-ldap/ldap) library to help with Active Directory authentication.

# Installing

Using Go Modules (v3): 

`go get github.com/korylprince/go-ad-auth/v3`

Using gopkg.in (v2):

`go get gopkg.in/korylprince/go-ad-auth.v3`

**Dependencies:**

* [github.com/go-ldap/ldap](https://github.com/go-ldap/ldap)
* [golang.org/x/text/encoding/unicode](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/text/encoding/unicode)

# API Versions

You should update to the `v3` API when possible. The new API is cleaner, more idiomatic, exposes a lot more functionality, and is fully testable.

`v3` was created to support Go Modules, so it is backwards compatible with `v2`. However, updates made to `v3` are not backported to `v2`.

The `v3` API is almost a complete rewrite of the older [`gopkg.in/korylprince/go-ad-auth.v1`](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/korylprince/go-ad-auth.v1) API. There are similarities, but `v3` is not backwards-compatible. 


One notable difference to be careful of is that while `v1`'s `Login` will return `false` if the user is not in the specified group, `v3`'s `AuthenticateExtended` will return `true` if the user authenticated successfully, regardless if they were in any of the specified groups or not.

# Usage

Example:

```go
config := &auth.Config{
    Server:   "ldap.example.com",
    Port:     389,
    BaseDN:   "OU=Users,DC=example,DC=com",
    Security: auth.SecurityStartTLS,
}

username := "user"
password := "pass"

status, err := auth.Authenticate(config, username, password)

if err != nil {
    //handle err
    return
}

if !status {
    //handle failed authentication
    return
}
```

# Testing

`go test -v`

Most tests will be skipped unless you supply the following environment variables to connect to an Active Directory server:

| Name                    | Description |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| ADTEST_SERVER           | Hostname or IP Address of an Active Directory server |
| ADTEST_PORT             | Port to use - defaults to 389 |
| ADTEST_BIND_UPN         | userPrincipalName (user@domain.tld) of admin user |
| ADTEST_BIND_PASS        | Password of admin user |
| ADTEST_BIND_SECURITY    | `NONE` \|\| `TLS` \|\| `STARTTLS` \|\| `INSECURETLS` \|\| `INSECURESTARTTLS` - defaults to `STARTTLS` |
| ADTEST_BASEDN           | LDAP Base DN - for testing the root DN is recommended, e.g. `DC=example,DC=com` |
| ADTEST_PASSWORD_UPN     | userPrincipalName of a test user that will be used to test password changing functions |

# Nested Groups

Since `v3.1.0`, [`AuthenticateExtended`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/korylprince/go-ad-auth/v3?tab=doc#AuthenticateExtended) and [`Conn.ObjectGroups`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/korylprince/go-ad-auth/v3?tab=doc#Conn.ObjectGroups) will automatically search for nested groups. For example, if `User A` is a member of `Group A`, and `Group A` is a member of `Group B`, using `Conn.ObjectGroups` on `User A` will return both `Group A` and `Group B`.

# Security

[SQL Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) is a well known attack vector, and most SQL libraries provide mitigations such as [prepared statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement). Similarly, [LDAP Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_LDAP_Injection_\(OTG-INPVAL-006\)), while not seen often in the wild, is something we should be concerned with.

Since `v2.2.0`, this library sanitizes inputs (with [`ldap.EscapeFilter`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-ldap/ldap/v3?tab=doc#EscapeFilter)) that are used to create LDAP filters in library functions, namely [`GetDN`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/korylprince/go-ad-auth/v3#Conn.GetDN) and [`GetAttributes`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/korylprince/go-ad-auth/v3#Conn.GetAttributes). This means high level functions in this library are protected against malicious inputs. If you use [`Search`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/korylprince/go-ad-auth/v3#Conn.Search) or [`SearchOne`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/korylprince/go-ad-auth/v3#Conn.SearchOne), take care to sanitize any untrusted inputs you use in your LDAP filter.
